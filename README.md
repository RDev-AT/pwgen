Now days everybody is up to security and data-safety. It seems legit, right? Not always!

Much to often passwords are crazy complex. So user needs to write them down somewhere or 
alter it to partly ridicules insecure ones. And just think of the user who forget their
credentials, lock their accounts. 

This avoidable lead to unexpected security risks. Like this, supposed secure passwords
can become to a real problem. 

Users who forget their credentials and lock their accounts several times not included.

Let's spend few seconds of silence to think about the support staff who have to fix all
that mess.
